CLI Over HTTP - A modern interface to old network devices

Many legacy network devices do not have a REST API available for interaction,
 and automation is done via scraping SSH connections.
 
There are many types of legacy network equipment which allow the user to open
 an HTTPS web server on the device and shuttle CLI commands via that interface.

This library enables the user to send CLI commands via these methods.
